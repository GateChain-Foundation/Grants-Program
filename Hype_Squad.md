1.2 Project Overview
We are building the first polish DAO community around blockchain and Web3 technology on various social media channels - Twitch, Discord, Twitter, etc. The main idea is to bring blockchain closer to the people, and at the beginning, members will not know that they are using blockchain to form, vote, and decide about the community's future. So the first part is to make the community use blockchain technology without knowing it's some new technology.


1.2.1 Project Introduction
I agreed with Warsaw government entities to host around 1h presentation in 100 high schools in Warsaw about Web3 - it will be the leading way to reach out to new DAO members and future blockchain users at the beginning. It gives me around 500 students and 50 teachers reach per school - 55000 in total.
Lectures will start in January 2023.

The first acquisition of the members will be grapevine in the web3 community, the next presentation at schools, and giveaways. After we reach a certain point of members, we will start influencers marketing (lives, interviews, etc)

We have already made partnerships with the biggest communities and web3 projects in Poland and we will announce it in Q1-Q2
1.3 Project details
The main goal is to build a community around web3 education in Poland. Poland community in Web3 is one of the biggest in Europe, so we will minimalize entry barriers for them.
Another main point is contact production. We will produce content daily on various social media channels to be easy to consume for people of every age, but we are mainly focused on young people - future web3 users. We will present health and sports apps for members who are into sports. We will introduce the games sector for gamers etc. And on top of that will be a DAO organization, so every member, no matter what interests him/her they, will be using blockchain technology.
1.3.1 Technology Stack Used

In the beginning, we are focused on building community, our goal is to make young people know more and use web3 so implementing technical aspects is useless. In Q2 OR Q3 we will implement the DAO aspect after we will educate the community about that, and release the NFT collection.
