**1.2** **Project Overview**  
This research project is primarily centered on the use of a constrained but simpler Neuronal (neuro-biological) auditory inspired machine intelligence technique to find solution to the price prediction problem in cryptocurrency markets when compared to existing techniques. 

**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**
Financial markets play an important role in the development of every day society as market commodities or financial assets have to be bought and sold and at competitive rates in order to meet the needs of a potential number of successful traders from a larger trader pool. This results in a potential huge set of minute-by-minute, hourly, and daily financial transactions and in turn corresponding profits or losses. The profits and losses are the result of bullish and bearish markets which is a direct consequence of the greed (or fear) index. Thus, it becomes necessary to develop and implement techniques and tools that will guide the trader in making profitable high yield financial decisions and hence minimize if not eliminate the losses or risks associated with bad decisions.
Neural inspired techniques have been valuable in this regard as tools for real time trading in financial markets. However, the problem of varying architectures, possibly increased complexity, increased computational time and diverse predictive abilities and optimization requirements have created a need for more simpler but efficient neural inspired techniques. 
This project seeks to develop a general enough neural inspired technique and tool that is scalable, of reduced complexity and operate in a much faster manner than existing neural techniques while assuring the profitabilty of potential users of this tool.

 **1.4** **Team**  
 The first and primary member of the team is Engr. Emmanuel Ndidi Osegi. Other members will be added in the course of the development. 
 **1.4.1** **Team Profile:**  
SurePay team is founded by Engr. Emmanuel Ndidi Osegi, an IT expert and CEO of SURE-GP Nig. Ltd, an AI start-up located in Port-Harcourt city, Rivers State Nigeria. 
The primary and initial purpose of SurePay team project is to provide a reliable and steady source of financial income to a vast majority of the economically disadvantaged people of Nigeria particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak via online digital market and financial trading money making solutions. 
In this regard the WhatsApp Group coined NaijaPrize was formed in late 2020. This group currently has over 50 members and its membership is gradually rising. The group promotes SurePay, a Knowledge Based Product (KBP) and concept of the SurePay Foundations Group that teaches members the fundamentals of digitized currencies called cryptocurrencies (cryptos) and how to trade or invest in these currencies.
