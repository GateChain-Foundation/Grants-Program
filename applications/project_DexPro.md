**1.2** **Project Overview**  
DexPro intends to establish a more professional decentralized trading platform, the existing mainstream AMM DEX such as uniswap, pancakeswap, user experience has a worse using-experience than CEX, we focus on the development of better trading supporting experience such as providing rich K line, capital analysis, optional trading, limited price trading, etc., further develop innovation Defi function such as support LP, NFT staking lending, etc.  
In addition, when we provide development support for other blockchain projects, we found that many enterprises, project parties themselves do not have blockchain technical team, but have a very strong demand for blockchain Defi function and high pay intention, so we also plan to turn blockchain Defi function gradually into a SaaS service, such as we will start from allowing users to build all kinds of farms and pools staking pool, etc.  
We will support as many more mainstream blockchain as Ethereum, BSC, HECO, gatechain, etc.

**1.3** **Project details**  

**1.3.1** **Technology Stack Used**  

Technology 1:   Solidity/Go

Technology 2:   JS/TS

Framework:  React/Gin/Truffle

**1.3.2** **Project Design Introduction**   
The project is based on the existing AMM mechanism to create a lower use threshold, easier to use, more powerful DEX and Defi system.  

Here is a prototype conceptual design of its featured features:  

**DEX direction:**  

1、Show users K transaction line, transaction volume, transaction records and other information  

Nowadays, mainstream AMM DEX is relatively simple compared with CEX function. We will provide DEX with various transaction information such as price in Fiat money, transaction K line, transaction volume, amount of the liquidity pool, transaction record, project information.  

![K transaction line Picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/K_transaction_line_picture.png)

2、Support the self-currency selection display, the introduction of trading currency data display area, etc  

The general AMM exchange only supports the selection of the transaction currency by searching for names or contracts, and cannot view the currency price easily. We introduce the self-selected transaction pair function to facilitate users to view the real-time pricing of their favorite currency directly in the DEX.

![self-currency selection display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/self-currency_selection_display.png)
![trading currency data display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/trading_currency_data_display.png)

3、Support for exchange rate conversion, rise and fall ranking, etc  

Support display Fiat currency pricing, such as USD, CNY pricing

4、Allow users to make limited price orders  

Ordinary AMM exchanges only support instant transactions, and we introduce the development of automatic limited price orders into DEX to automatically meet eligible transactions.  


<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/limit_price_orders.png width=333 height=622 />

5、supports using the platform token to pay the deduction fees  

![supports using the platform token to pay the deduction fees](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/deduction_fees.png)  

**Defi direction:**  

1、Support for LP pledge lending  

In addition to the general LP staking mining function, DEX Pro will also develop the LP pledge lending function,it support the pledge LP using for borrowing. In addition to supporting the LP pledge of our platform, we also plans to support the LP pledge of other mainstream AMM exchanges, such as uniswap, pancakeswap, etc.

<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/LP_pledge_lending_2.png width=333 height=622 />

2、NFT pledge mining and lending (quotation model)  

Support NFT pledge mining, pledge and lending, pledge and lending will use the quotation mechanism to determine the amount of lending.

3、Add the reward algorithm based on the change of the pledge time  

Innovate the pledge reward calculation method, and introduce the influence of time factor, which can set the reward rate to increase the reward rate with the increase of pledge time, this can help stay more user for the project party.  

![Add the reward algorithm based on the change of the pledge time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flylingbu/Grants-Program/main/applications/assets/images/reward.png) 

4、Allow users to create a LP pledge reward pool and a single-currency pledge reward pool by themselves  

This function is inspired by our development and application for other blockchain projects, many enterprises are very interested in blockchain and Defi, eager to integrate blockchain technology into its business, including financing, marketing, fans, feedback, etc., but now Defi functions still need to complex development can be adopted, and we will start from developing a highly available SaaS pledge pool for users, gradually SaaS more Defi functions, to provide more companies without technical team and want to use blockchain technology.  

Users create the LP pledge reward pool and the single-currency pledge reward pool by themselves:  

Self-service upper a pool in the form of voting + auction:  

For example:  

1: Fill in the fixed form, submit project data, pool funds, display information, audit report, etc. (consider preliminary review, screening by contracts or DAO in the later stage)  

2: Project sorting voting, voting using the platform native token voting, charging a small fee for voting  

3: The top 30 voting items will automatically enter the bidding ranking procedure, conduct bidding through the preset bidding address, and the project will pay the DEXPro token for bidding   

4: The top 10 bidding players pass automatically. The project party can set up a pool that support 30d for free, and charge additional fee for the time over 30d  

Submit the Form:

1, cryptocurrency trader  

2, Defi users  

3, Companies and groups that want to use defi  

**1.3.4** **TOKEN model design**  

The project has not issued tokens in the seed financing stage, and will improve the design of the token mechanism and economic model during the development stage;  

The use of the project platform token is now known as follows:  
1、Give the LP staking rewards  
2、Reward the single currency mine pool  
3、As a handling fee deduction for various platform functions  
4、The fee paid as the application staking pool  
5、Used for pledge lending, casting NFT, etc

**Write at the end:**

I have been exposed to blockchain in 2017 and after experiencing the Market turmoil of 2017 ~ 19, I have used to thought that blockchain industry is just make for a pure speculative market. But in 2019 and 2020,the development of Defi really made me realize that I was thinking wrong and corrected my idea completely. In 2018, I used to thought about what if we using the decentralized blockchain tech into some application of P2P, then may the collective thunder incident of P2P will not happen. However, due to the unmature situation at that time, the low market quotes made me have a relatively pessimistic mood about the development of blockchain at that time.  
But now, I doubt no more, and firmly believe that blockchain technology will be one of the most promising technologies in the next 10 years. First of all, the reform that now gradually permeates the financial field, I believe that decentralized finance will gradually revolutionize the traditional centralized system, to all kinds of P2P, finance, lending, integral systems,even to the IPO,  will be gradually changed by the decentralized mechanism, making financial services more transparent, universal, fair, and can benefit everyone. And this is just the beginning, DAO has the power to make a different in all industries.  
For example, in 2017,the founder of KUAIDI has proposed to use blockchain technology to build a decentralized Didi/UBER, but limited to the development of blockchain technology and industry, as well as people's acceptance of the concept of decentralization, or proposed that the founder himself did not implement it consistently, this conception did not continue. But it doesn't mean that these ideas are wrong. It's just like the first tablet-PC was invented by Microsoft, but it is Apple making it popular, just the reason of the right time.  
And we are now determined to join the construction of a decentralized system, hoping that we can think big,but start small, and can eventually make a different.  
We will start from the Defi decentralized finance into the field of blockchain technology development, base on the existing Defi achievements to learn and make innovation, constantly promote the application and popularization of blockchain and decentralized technology, and can eventually penetrate into other industries, establish many other kinds of DAO organization system, promote blockchain decentralization, producing audit free, reliability innovation solutions that the traditional industry workflow cannot achieve.  
We will use all means to finance the project,we heartily expect the support of gateio, and we will humbly accept any suggestions in any respect.   
Finally, thanks again for reading!
