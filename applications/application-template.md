**1.2** **Project Overview**  
Syntifi is building the next generation of financial crime prevention tool, a cross-chain risk intelligence tool. We do believe that with the great power of decentralized finance comes the great responsibility of ensuring that no financial crime, money laundering or terrorist financing is taking place. For this reason,  some crucial capabilities of our tool is made available open source. In this grant we ask for support to add yet another blockchain to our growing ecosystem.

**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**

The main issue in fighting financial crime is that traditional and crypto financial institutions manage their own Anti Money Laundering (AML) processes independently. These same institutions continue to invest enormous resources in INTERNAL systems to fight financial crime and fulfill regulatory requirements. Yet, financial crime occurs across institutions and jurisdictions in both crypto- and fiat worlds. Closer collaboration between the market players is fundamental, but privacy regulations and banking secrecy rules prevent data sharing. The result is an industry on the verge of a revolution that still relies on regulatory processes of the last century. The blockchain technology solves some of these problems by providing a secure and reliable ledger to all stakeholders. Syntifi is here to close the gap and provide on-chain tools to investigate and monitor financial transactions stored across-chains.

Furthermore, governments are starting to tighten regulatory requirements for Crypto related transactions. According to Reuters1, “Companies that transfer BTC or other cryptoassets must collect details of senders and recipients to help authorities crack down on dirty money, EU policymakers proposed on Tuesday in the latest efforts to tighten regulation of the sector. The law, which is one of the recommendations of the inter-governmental watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), already applies to wire transfers. Providing anonymous crypto-asset wallets will also be prohibited, just as anonymous bank accounts are already banned under EU anti-money laundering rules.”
