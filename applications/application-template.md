**1.2** **Project Overview**  

Playground Protocol is a creative networking and collaboration platform that places the power in the hands of the creator. Our application has many facets to fully understanding the depth of our vision and mission. Our platform is a collaboration and networking platform that hosts a variety of interests, topics, and passions to build real communities for the betterment and growth of all our users. Our platform is a powerful tool for all creatives to earn a new form of income, using our respective crypto token "CREATE", for collaborating within our platform. Our platform will include a digital wallet for storage of our crypto token 'CREATE', an NFT Marketplace for commercialization of any digital media, collaboration, or content created through our platform, a unique video-calling function for peer-to-peer collaboration/expression, and more. Our platform will also offer services for creatives such as production, design, mentorship, and much more available for purchase with our CREATE Token that users can earn for completing and accomplishing collaborations within our platform. 

**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**

**1.3** **Project details**

Whatever topics, passions, and interests that bring people together, will be found on our platform. Whether it be musicians collaborating on a song together, photographers collaborating with designers, software developers collaborating on projects, sports-lovers coming together to speak about sports, video gamers accomplishing achievements together, parents working together to find better ways to raise children, philosophers collaborating on ideas and self-truths, bodybuilders sharing exercise techniques, social media influencers working together, spiritual seekers speaking about self-care routines, etc: you can find on our platform. Our platform will streamline the process of collaboration and expression in a highly organized and efficient way. Our goal is to decentralize communities and industries in a way that encourages and incentivizes the growth of each individual as well as dissolves corporate boundaries that arise from traditional/orthodox businesses in order to promote cross-field collaboration. Whatever an individual may find interesting or beneficial, they can find a real, 'Open-Source Style' community of likeminded individuals within our platform.
