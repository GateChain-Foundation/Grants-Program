**1.2** **Project Overview**  

Playground Protocol is a creative networking and collaboration platform that places the power in the hands of the creator. Our application has many facets to fully understanding the depth of our vision and mission. Our platform is a collaboration and networking platform that hosts a variety of interests, topics, and passions to build real communities for the betterment and growth of all our users. Our platform is a powerful tool for all creatives to earn a new form of income, using our respective crypto token "CREATE", for collaborating within our platform. Our platform will include a digital wallet for storage of our crypto token 'CREATE', an NFT Marketplace for commercialization of any digital media, collaboration, or content created through our platform, a unique video-calling function for peer-to-peer collaboration/expression, and more. Our platform will also offer services for creatives such as production, design, mentorship, freelance work from fellow users and much more available for purchase with our CREATE Token that users can earn for completing and accomplishing collaborations.

**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**

Playground Protocol will be a unique, all-inclusive, and powerful tool for all creatives regardless of the form or medium of expression. There are currently no applications or platforms that have the breadth, depth, and vision that we have. In the past two years (given recent circumstances around the globe), individuals have found more ways than ever to be creative. We believe that all peoples, regardless of their background, have an innate creative spark lying dormant within most. Our main goal is to create a safe-space for efficient collaborations that is devoid of any contracts/fees where we take no ownership of the intellectual property created through our platform. Our goal is to provide a platform that incentivizes growth above all else via our respective CREATE Token. Creative minds from all walks of life can come together to find their dream team on our platform, earn CREATE Tokens for their growth within the platform, and then pay it forward by helping other users to hone their skills in whatever creative interests they may have.

**1.3** **Project details**

Whatever topics, passions, and interests that bring people together, will be found on our platform. Whether it be musicians collaborating on a song together, photographers collaborating with designers, software developers collaborating on projects, sports-lovers coming together to speak about sports, video gamers accomplishing achievements together, parents working together to find better ways to raise children, philosophers collaborating on ideas and self-truths, bodybuilders sharing exercise techniques, social media influencers working together, spiritual seekers speaking about self-care routines, etc: you can find on our platform. Our platform will streamline the process of collaboration and expression in a highly organized and efficient way. Our goal is to decentralize communities and industries in a way that encourages and incentivizes the growth of each individual as well as dissolves corporate boundaries that arise from traditional/orthodox businesses in order to promote cross-field collaboration. Whatever an individual may find interesting or beneficial, they can find a real, 'Open-Source Style' community of likeminded individuals within our platform.

The Playground Protocol Platform will consist of a website, and downloadable application for access to the UI which will feature a streamlined, easy-to-use process for the following components: 
1. Platform Search Engine with Detailed Parameters - For our users to find the perfect collaborators they are looking for in order to accomplish projects together. 
2. Built-In Digital Wallet - For the storage, and trading aspect of our crypto token 'CREATE', enabling us to reward our users quickly, and efficiently for collaborations/growth.
3. Social Networking Components - For public profile creation to interact with other users. Consisting of a bio, profile pic, user information, and a creative showcase (post timeline/feed) where users can uplod their created content and completed collaborations to display to fellow users. 
4. NFT Marketplace & Commercialization Model - For our users to mint NFT's of their creative works and sell within the marketplace available for purchase with CREATE Tokens.
