**1.2** **Project Overview**  
To onboard in real life artists into web3 technology, proper onboarding steps need to be carried out as well as incentivizing the artists to take the steps. Charged Particles and Unchained Music are examples of organizations with individuals from them being both influenced by and influencing the XCHC community. Members from all these organizations now realize the need to make full steps into the web3 space but need support in creating onboarding processes. The XCHC recently made a purchase of metaverse land that will enable artists to showcase their art in a virtual gallery tied to a physical location (similar to Pokemon Go) as well as cryptovoxels parcels that will allow people to stream music into the metaverse space. Recently the cryptovoxels parcels were used the artwork of 40+ artists in 52 different NFTs, music from an in real life event (both main stage and boiler room of Mary Hush) was streamed into the parcel allowing numerous New Zealand djs to be experienced by an international audience, and culminated with a full day of talks around regenerative finance from world leaders that got streamed into the physical XCHC location. Through bridging physical art to virtual art, we were able to connect people with art they would not of been able to experience otherwise. The 52 different NFTs were auctioned and resulted in 5.3 ETH being donated to environmental organizations around the world through Giveth! Now we are working with more New Zealand artists to onboard their work into this space. An example of this is an upcoming event September 10th that will allow a digital artist that has been making art for decades to portray their art in the metaverse and have the NFTs that are auctioned, gather resources for mental health organizations on Giveth. 
In the metaverse not only the art, but the stories of the artists and why they created the art will be portrayed. Especially for events. An example of such an event is Mary Hush. Mary Hush is a pop-up event that inhabits abandoned/industrial spaces around the city, inviting artists to create an immersive art experience for 1-night only. Along with that they were one of the first spaces to incorporate gamification, and NFTs into their events. Enabling further art created for these events to become part of the metaverse will build momentum for more of these events to occur and artists to be supported in this movement. Throughout this movement, a percent of the funding would not only support artists but would be channeled towards real life change and organizations that are inspiring it. 


**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**
Web3 technology is often disconnected from in real life applications and the people that could benefit from them. Letting preconceived ideas about why web3 is bad block their ability to utilize these technologies, people that could benefit from them the most do not. One example is artists. Without having somebody to talk with artists about the technology and facilitate them embracing this technology, artists are not able to be benefitted from it. 
For many artists, creating new NFTs, as well as attracting and maintaining communities that believe in their project is an issue. In Christchurch, New Zealand there is a community of artists (tied to a physical location XCHC) creating a movement in real life through creative events and facilitating spaces in a way that enables community and culture to thrive. However, this community has only started to embrace web3. As a fairly young and small country, the culture has room to improve with their standard of entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. This ultimately leaves many dissatisfied, feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is especially known for being largely consertive, “closing early”, clique art world, and most “music venues' ' are just bars profiteering off music, leaving most alternative/original music overlooked. Though the XCHC  has been doing great work with artists for 7+ years, this community remains a bit hidden from the wider world (as we’re sure most alternative/independant art spaces can relate). Artists here remain disconnected from the global reach and possibilities enabled by embracing web3 technology, such as NFTs, tokens, and DAOs. However, some are ready to take the next step. 
Once people embrace web3, initially it’s often for personal gain and not for public good. Without utilizing this technology for public good, people are unable to see the huge benefits for the world that can come from web3. By embracing web3 through an artistic community and ensuring that the community is guided by doing public good, we can create a more positive narrative than is currently portrayed in many media outlets.

Preston | Community Builder
I've been running one of New Zealands few self-funded artist run spaces for the last 5 years; working with all creative disciplines including music, visual, installation, performance, digital works & recently NFT projects. Due to having a variety of production, showcase, and residency spaces, our interarts space has become the largest collective of creatives in NZ. We experiment with culture, more regenerative models, and impact driven work which has lead to advising on Arts Recovery funding for Manatū Taonga (National Ministry for Arts and Culture), advising on a creative marine education centre in Rarotonga (Cook Islands), and becoming a Global Shaper with the World Economic Forum.
Now looking at expanding nationwide to create a crossover between the digital and the physical. Preston is also a core member of Mary Hush, a collective (lead by our team) that organizes invite-only intentional nightlife/immersive art events featuring creative work from all over NZ and bridges the gap between the metaverse and IRL events.

Gregg has worked with gatherings around the world and has been involved/lead 12 builds for regional burn events and festivals. His recognition for leadership and building has earned him collaborations with designers from WETA Workshop and roles in some of New Zealands top festivals.
