**1.2** **Project Overview**  

**1.2.1** **Project Introduction**
	
	The goal of the project is to create a Learn To Earn Platform where we can provide educational content about NFTs and Metaverse.
	With this platform we want to be the main way for people to learn about the new world of NFTs. Beside that, we want to have a social goal of educating people in poverty through ONGs and social associations - companies can donate money to our pool and we distribute it through the educational courses.
	This also can be used on the Gate website as a good way to bring more people to the crypto universe - they learn, earn and can use the money on Gate platform.

	Leverage blockchain and crypto to promote financial literacy, educational empowerment and social transformation. Bring relevant subjects and engage the community to learn about NFTS.

	In short, we want to educate people and be the gateway to the crypto universe.


**1.3** **Project details**  

	People are entering the crypto market with false promises and illusions and they suffer when
	they lose money, either because of lack of education, too much greed, or being deceived by scams.
	We want to be able to deliver content that teaches them how to protect themselves and how to analyze good projects.
	We believe that NFT games are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and we want to bring the knowledge they 
	need to get in and stay, keep investing and earning money to help their families. 

	We already have a community of people. We are bringing daily content and news about NFTs through 4 main categories: Games, Music, Sports and Arts.

	In each category we found a lot of different and great use cases that we can teach in the courses.
	Our first step was the creation and free distribution of our NFT Ebook - Essential NFTs guide for 2022 (in portuguese)
